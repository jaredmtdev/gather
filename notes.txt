TODO:

-setup benchmarks
-can we provide any mechanism for easy sharding?
-how to handle maintaining order of results even if processing out of order?
-test Scope
-have simple examples + possible real-world examples
-include WithErrChan()? this way middleware can wrap errors and get the full details sent
--no: there's too many ways to design this and it would add complexity. instead: use middleware for shared err chan + wrapped errors
-give an example that uses closures such that you have less input parameters - enabling you to chain workers


examples ideas:
-middlware: captures wrapped errors and sends to error channel that is used for all stages
-use closures to chain stages together nicely
